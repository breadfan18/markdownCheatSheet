## Text Formatting
- *Italicize*  - by using one a set of one *s around the text.  

- **Bold**  - by using set of two *s around the text.

- Underline - Tough Luck, apparently markdown doesn't have a definte syntax to underline. :(

- > Block Quotes - Create block quotes by using the ">" symbol at the beginnign of sentesces.
   It will add a block as such this. The  text will keep wrapping in the block, until there's an empty line is added.
