## Text Formatting
- *Italicize*  - by using one a set of one *s around the text.  

- **Bold**  - by using set of two *s around the text.

- Underline - Tough Luck, apparently markdown doesn't have a definte syntax to underline. :(

- ~~Strikeout~~ - Use ~~ symbols around the text for strikeout.  

- > Block Quotes - Create block quotes by using the ">" symbol at the beginnign of sentesces.
   It will add a block as such this. The  text will keep wrapping in the block, until there's an empty line is added. 

- Bulleted Lists (Using the '-' hyphen symbol, and indentation to create sub lists)
   - List 1
      - Sublist 1
      - Sublist 2
   - List 2
   - List 3

- Numbered Lists (Use the number 1 to create numbered lists. You can use bulleted sublists within numbered lists)
   1. This is how
      - bulleted list
      - within numbered list
   1. you create
   1. a numbered list
      
 ```
